//This is a tough subject.
//When you call Child() in the main method, you not only print child but also parent's because you extended Child to Parent.
//c.printName() is originally used to call Child()'s printName(). But, since you don't have the particular method, the system refers it to parent's class
//because you inherited Child from Parent class.
//Tips:
//When a child constructor is being called, parent's class constructor will also be called.
//You can only inherit public or protected variables and method from parent class.
//You cannot inherit 2 class at the same time.

public class Child extends Parent {
	public Child() {
		System.out.println("Child Constructor");
	}
	
}

public class Parent {
	public Parent() {
		System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
	}
public void printName() {
	System.out.println("Parent printName()");
}
}
public class InheritancePrint {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Child c= new Child();
		c.printName();
